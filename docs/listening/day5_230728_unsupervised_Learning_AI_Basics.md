Unsupervised learning is a technique field artificial intelligence, it allows computers to find patterns and information without anyone tell you what to look for. In supervised learning, the computer need to be told what to do and give information to work with. But with unsupervised learning, it has to figure it out all on its own, using something called clustering algorithms, to group things that similar. This can review patterns that we might not see right way, but computer group things collecting clusters, that review hidden patterns and insights.

For example, if a store wants to know what is a custum wants to buy, unsupervised learning can help by tracking an grouping spending patterns. The store can use these information to make better ads on creating more paying sale offers.

Unsupervised learning is even being used in outer space, it helps scientists analyse information collecting by telesocps. This is helping on uncover new patterns and structures in the universe. This reverlusion ÂçóÁëû technique AI can help us make new discovers and see things in new ways. It allows us to find hidden patterns and new reluation shapes that can improve our understanding of the world and be young.
