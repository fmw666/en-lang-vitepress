#### [Intro]
Oh, hi

#### [Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br>
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price<br>
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

#### [Pre-Chorus]
Killin' me slow, out the window<br>
I'm always waitin' for you to be waitin' below<br>
Devils roll their dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

#### [Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body<br>
It's blue, the feelin' I've got<br>
And it's ooh, woah-oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
No rules in breakable heaven<br>
But ooh, woah-oh<br>
It's a cru–µl summer with you

#### [Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of th–µ vending machine<br>
I'm not dyin' (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times<br>
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

#### [Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife<br>
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone<br>
Devils roll their dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh<br>

#### [Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body<br>
It's blue, the feelin' I've got<br>
And it's ooh, woah-oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
No rules in breakable heaven<br>
But ooh, woah-oh<br>
It's a cruel summer with you

#### [Break]
Alright, Los Angeles, we have arrived<br>
At the very first bridge of the evening<br>
Now, I have a question<br>
Does anyone here know the lyrics to this bridge?<br>
Prove it

#### [Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)<br>
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true<br>
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)<br>
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth<br>
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"<br>
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

#### [Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body<br>
It's blue, the feelin' I've got<br>
And it's ooh, woah-oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
No rules in breakable heaven<br>
But ooh, woah-oh<br>
It's a cruel summer

#### [Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)<br>
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true<br>
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)<br>
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth<br>
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"<br>
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Cruel summer<br>
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)<br>
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)<br>
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)<br>
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)<br>
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)<br>
It's a cruel summer
