| Nice to meet you, where you been?         | /naɪs tu ^ mi~~t~~ ju ^ hwer ju ^ bɪn/        |
| I could show you incredible things        | /aɪ kʊ~~d~~ ʃo-ju ɪnˈkredəb(ə)l θɪŋz/         |
| Magic, madness, heaven, sin               | /ˈmædʒɪk ^ ˈmæ~~d~~nəs ^ ˈhev(ə)n ^ sɪn/      |
| Saw you there and I thought               | /sɔ ju ðe^r-ən~~d~~-aɪ θɔː~~t~~/              |
| "Oh, my God, look at that face            | /oʊ maɪ ɡɑd ^ lʊk-ə~~t~~ ðæ~~t~~ feɪs/        |
| You look like my next mistake             | /juː lʊ<u>k</u> laɪ<u>k</u> mai nɛx<u>t</u> ˈmɪsktərəs/ |
| Love's a game, wanna play? Ay             | /lʊvz-ə ɡeɪm ˈwænə pleɪ ^ aɪ/ |
| New money, suit and tie                   |  |
| I can read you like a magazine            |  |
| Ain't it funny? Rumors fly                |  |
| And I know you heard about me             |  |
| So hey, let's be friends                  |  |
| I'm dying to see how this one ends        |  |
| Grab your passport and my hand            |  |
| I can make the bad guys good for a weekend|  |
| **[verse]**                                                                               |
| So it's gonna be forever                  |  |
| Or it's gonna go down in flames           |  |
| You can tell me when it's over, mm        |  |
| If the high was worth the pain            |  |
| Got a long list of ex-lovers              | /ga~~də~~ lɑːŋ lɪs^~~t~~d-ə veks lʌv.ərz/     |
| They'll tell you I'm insane               |  |
| 'Cause you know I love the players        |  |
| And you love the game                     |  |
| 'Cause we're young, and we're reckless    |  |
| We'll take this way too far               |  |
| It'll leave you breathless, mm            |  |
| Or with a nasty scar                      |  |
| Got a long list of ex-lovers              |  |
| They'll tell you I'm insane               |  |
| But I've got a blank space, baby          | /bʌ~~t~~d-aɪv ^ ɡɑː~~t~~də blæŋk-s^beɪs ^ ˈbeɪ.bi/ |
| And I'll write your name                  | /æn~~d~~-aɪl ^ ɔ raɪt~jʊr neɪm/               |
| Cherry lips, crystal skies                |  |
| I could show you incredible things        |  |
| Stolen kisses, pretty lies                |  |
| You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen     |  |
| Find out what you want                    |  |
| Be that girl for a month                  |  |
| Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no    |  |
| Screaming, crying, perfect storms         |  |
| I can make all the tables turn            |  |
| Rose garden filled with thorns            |  |
| Keep you second guessing like             |  |
| "Oh, my God, who is she?"                 |  |
| I get drunk on jealousy                   |  |
| But you'll come back each time you leave  |  |
| 'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream |  |
| So it's gonna be forever                  |  |
| Or it's gonna go down in flames           |  |
| You can tell me when it's over, mm        |  |
| If the high was worth the pain            |  |
| Got a long list of ex-lovers              |  |
| They'll tell you I'm insane               |  |

| 'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh) |  |
| We'll take this way too far               |  |
| It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh)       |  |
| Or with a nasty scar                      |  |
| Got a long list of ex-lovers              |  |
| They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)      |  |
| But I've got a blank space, baby          |  |
| And I'll write your name                  |  |
| Boys only want love if it's torture       |  |
| Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya  |  |
| Boys only want love if it's torture       |  |
| Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya  |  |
| So it's gonna be forever                  |  |
| Or it's gonna go down in flames           |  |
| You can tell me when it's over (over)     |  |
