:::warning [Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser<br>
Midnights become my afternoons<br>
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people<br>
I've ghosted stand there in the room
:::

:::warning [Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices<br>
They come with prices and vices<br>
I end up in crisis<br>
(Tale as old as time)<br>
I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
'Cause you got tired of my scheming<br>
(For the last time)
:::

:::warning [Chorus]
It's me, hi<br>
I'm the problem, it's me<br>
At teatime, everybody agrees<br>
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
:::

:::warning [Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby<br>
And I'm a monster on the hill<br>
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city<br>
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
:::

:::warning [Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism<br>
Like some kind of congressman?<br>
(A tale as old as time)<br>
I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
And life will lose all its meaning<br>
(For the last time)
:::

:::warning [Chorus]
It's me, hi<br>
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
At teatime, everybody agrees<br>
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
:::

:::warning [Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money<br>
She thinks I left them in the will<br>
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out<br>
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"
:::

:::warning [Breakdown]
It's me, hi<br>
I'm the problem, it's me<br>
It's me, hi<br>
I'm the problem, it's me<br>
It's me, hi<br>
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
:::

:::warning [Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)<br>
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)<br>
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
